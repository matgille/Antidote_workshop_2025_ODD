   <!-- Steps: 
   1. Using ROMA, create an ODD adapted to this particular document. Get rid of any module / element that is not needed. I recommend using the
   2. Transform the ODD into a RNG/RNC schema and test the file against this schema.
   3. Fine-tune your ODD directly in the file: 
         a. the divisions must be typed and numbered. Division types values should be a closed list.
         b. the line begining elements should indicate whether the element breaks a word or not
         c. Find one element to constrain at attribute level. 
   4. Optional. Create a small mockup documentation in your ODD, and transform it into HTML.
   NB: feel free to use your own material if you prefer. In this case, choose 3 rules you want to implement,
   and create a small documentation of your encoding principles. The structure of this documentation is (at least its main components) in the ODD 
   produced by ROMA.
